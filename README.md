Url Shortner using node and express JS

Description
A URL shortener is an app that converts a long URL into a short URL. The idea is to minimize the web page address into something that's easier to remember and track. Typically, it shortens the website's address and adds a random combination of letters and numbers.

Features
I have added a basic UI with a table of the redirects and visit history to highlight any unique aspects.
